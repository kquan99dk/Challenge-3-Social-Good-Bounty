Our vision is to see more people from all backgrounds, developing a life-long habit of reading for pleasure and benefitting from the improved life chances this brings them. By making a donation or raising funds for READING CULTURE FUNDRAISE, you can help us change lives through a love of books and shared reading.


The READING CULTURE FUNDRAISE Ignition is a campaign to launch the READING IGNITION. The campaign will begin on May 1 2022 and will be live until July 15 2022. It will kickstart the READING IGNITION and boost the reading culture for people from all ages and from all walks of life.

The funds you raise help us to:


Give everyone a book of their own: A donation helps us get book tokens and books to everyone all over the world, especially those from poor and underdeveloped countries. They do not have the economic conditions to buy books and are not aware of the importance of reading books. 
Encourage more to read for pleasure: By making books fun and accessible, we transform attitudes to reading encouraging more families, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to enjoy books together.


Ensure access to books for every child: Working with local communities, libraries and charity partners we deliver exciting activities to encourage everyone and get books to the children and young people who need them most.


Thank you for helping us to change lives through reading and access to books.
